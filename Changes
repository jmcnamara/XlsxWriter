  Python 2 users should use XlsxWriter version 2.0.0, see below.

Release 2.0.0 - August 9 2021
-----------------------------

  and new features will only be available for Python 3. The deprecation notice

  Python community support for Python 2 ended in January 2020. Downloads of
  XlsxWriter for Python 2 is currently less than 6% of all downloads of the

  this release but not any releases afterwards.

-------------------------------

* Fixed issue where custom chart data labels didn't inherit the position of
  the data labels in the series. :issue:`754`.

Release 1.3.6 - September 23 2020
---------------------------------

* Added the worksheet :func:`unprotect_range()` method to allow ranges within

* There are now over 1500 test cases in the test suite, including 900 tests

  :issue:`677`.


Release 1.2.7 - December 23 2019
--------------------------------

* Fix for duplicate images being copied to an XlsxWriter file. Excel uses an
  optimization where it only stores one copy of a repeated/duplicate image in
  a workbook. XlsxWriter didn't do this which meant that the file size would
  increase when then was a large number of repeated images. This release fixes
  that issue and replicates Excel's behavior. :issue:`615`.

* Added documentation on :ref:`num_format_categories` and
  :ref:`num_format_locale`.

* Added note to :func:`protect()` about how it is possible to encrypt an
  XlsxWriter file using a third party, cross platform, open source tool called

  constructor.

  have size changes that occur after the comment is written. :issue:`403` and
  :issue:`312`.

* Added fix for the sizing of worksheet objects (images, charts, textboxes)
  when the underlying cell sizes have changed and the "object_position"
  parameter has been set to 1 "Move and size with cells". An additional mode 4
  has been added to simulate inserting the object in hidden rows.
  :issue:`618`.

* Added object positioning for charts and textboxes, it was already supported
  for images. Note, the parameter is now called ``object_position``. The

  for images. :issue:`568`.

----------------------------

* Fixed issue where images that started in hidden rows/columns weren't placed
  correctly in the worksheet. :issue:`613`.

* Fixed the mime-type reported by system ``file(1)``. The mime-type reported

  expected the ``[Content_types]`` to be the first file in the zip container.
  :issue:`614`.


Release 1.1.5 - February 22 2019
--------------------------------

* This version removes support for end of life Pythons 2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2 and

  automatically, see :func:`close()`.
