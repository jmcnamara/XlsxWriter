      XlsxWriter maintains a high level of compatibility with Excel. However,
      OpenOffice and LibreOffice do not always render xlsx files in the same way as Excel. 
      It is important to first check if the issue you are reporting is due to XlsxWriter
      or to OpenOffice or LibreOffice.

    - label: I have tested the output file with Excel.
