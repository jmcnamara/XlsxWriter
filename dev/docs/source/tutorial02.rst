Tutorial 2: Adding formatting to the XLSX File
==============================================

.. highlight:: python

In the previous section we created a simple spreadsheet using Python and the
XlsxWriter module.

This converted the required data into an Excel file but it looked a little
bare. In order to make the information clearer we would like to add some
simple formatting, like this:

.. image:: _images/tutorial02.png

The differences here are that we have added **Item** and **Cost** column
headers in a bold font, we have formatted the currency in the second column
and we have made the **Total** string bold.

To do this we can extend our program as follows:

.. only:: html

   (The significant changes are shown with a red line.)

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 7-15, 32, 36-37

    import xlsxwriter

    # Create a workbook and add a worksheet.
    workbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook('Expenses02.xlsx')
    worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet()

    # Add a bold format to use to highlight cells.
    bold = workbook.add_format({'bold': True})

    # Add a number format for cells with money.
    money = workbook.add_format({'num_format': '$#,##0'})

    # Write some data headers.
    worksheet.write('A1', 'Item', bold)
    worksheet.write('B1', 'Cost', bold)

    # Some data we want to write to the worksheet.
    expenses = (
        ['Rent', 1000],
        ['Gas',   100],
        ['Food',  300],
        ['Gym',    50],
    )

    # Start from the first cell below the headers.
    row = 1
    col = 0

    # Iterate over the data and write it out row by row.
    for item, cost in (expenses):
        worksheet.write(row, col,     item)
        worksheet.write(row, col + 1, cost, money)
        row += 1

    # Write a total using a formula.
    worksheet.write(row, 0, 'Total',       bold)
    worksheet.write(row, 1, '=SUM(B2:B5)', money)

    workbook.close()

The main difference between this and the previous program is that we have added
two :ref:`Format <Format>` objects that we can use to format cells in the
spreadsheet.

Format objects represent all of the formatting properties that can be applied
to a cell in Excel such as fonts, number formatting, colors and borders. This
is explained in more detail in :ref:`format` section.

For now we will avoid getting into the details and just use a limited amount of
the format functionality to add some simple formatting::

    # Add a bold format to use to highlight cells.
    bold = workbook.add_format({'bold': True})

    # Add a number format for cells with money.
    money = workbook.add_format({'num_format': '$#,##0'})

We can then pass these formats as an optional third parameter to the
:ref:`worksheet. <Worksheet>`:func:`write()` method to format the data in the
cell::

    write(row, column, token, [format])

Like this::

    worksheet.write(row, 0, 'Total', bold)

Which leads us to another new feature in this program. To add the headers in
the first row of the worksheet we used :func:`write()` like this::

    worksheet.write('A1', 'Item', bold)
    worksheet.write('B1', 'Cost', bold)

So, instead of ``(row, col)`` we used the Excel ``'A1'``  style notation. See
:ref:`cell_notation` for more details but don't be too concerned about it for
now. It is just a little syntactic sugar to help with laying out worksheets.

In the next section we will look at handling more data types.
