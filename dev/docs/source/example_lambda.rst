Example: Excel 365 LAMBDA() function
====================================

This program is an example of using the new Excel ``LAMBDA()`` function. It
demonstrates how to create a lambda function in Excel and also how to assign a
name to it so that it can be called as a user defined function. This
particular example converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

See the :ref:`formula_lambda` section of the documentation for more details.
