Sponsorship and Donations
-------------------------

I write and maintain a series of open source libraries for creating Excel
files. The most commonly used are XlsxWriter in Python, Libxlsxwriter in C and
Excel::Writer::XLSX and Spreadsheet::WriteExcel in Perl.

My aim is to write well documented and well tested code that does what the
user needs and doesn't get in their way.  You can help make this continue, or
show your appreciation for work to date, by becoming a
`GitHub Sponsor <https://github.com/sponsors/jmcnamara>`_.
