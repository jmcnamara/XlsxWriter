Example: Combined Chart
=======================

Example of creating combined Excel charts with two chart types.

In the first example we create a combined column and line chart that share the
same X and Y axes.

   :scale: 75 %

In the second example we create a similar combined column and line chart
except that the secondary chart has a secondary Y axis.
