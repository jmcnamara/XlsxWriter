Example: Clustered Chart
========================

Example of creating a clustered Excel chart where there are two levels of
category on the X axis.

   :scale: 75 %

The categories in clustered charts are 2D ranges, instead of the more normal
1D ranges. The series are shown as formula strings for clarity but you can also
use the a list syntax.
