worksheet1.set_column('A:A', 30)
worksheet2.set_column('A:A', 30)
worksheet3.set_column('A:A', 30)

# Hide Sheet2. It won't be visible until it is unhidden in Excel.
worksheet2.hide()

worksheet1.write('A1', 'Sheet2 is hidden')
worksheet2.write('A1', "Now it's my turn to find you!")
worksheet3.write('A1', 'Sheet2 is hidden')

# Note, you can't hide the the "active" worksheet, which generally is the
# first worksheet, since this would cause an Excel error. So, in order to hide
# the first sheet you will need to activate another worksheet:
#
#    worksheet2.activate()
#    worksheet1.hide()

workbook.close()
