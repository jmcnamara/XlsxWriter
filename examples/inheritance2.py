# Example of how to subclass the Workbook and Worksheet objects. See also the
# simpler inheritance1.py example.
#
# In this example we see an approach to implementing a simulated autofit in a
# user application. This works by overriding the write_string() method to
# track the maximum width string in each column and then set the column
# widths.
#
# Note: THIS ISN'T A FULLY FUNCTIONAL AUTOFIT EXAMPLE. It is only a proof or
# concept or a framework to try out solutions.
